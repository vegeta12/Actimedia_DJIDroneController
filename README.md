# DJI Mobile SDK for Android

## What Is This?

The DJI Mobile SDK enables you to automate your DJI Product. You can control flight, and many subsystems of the product including the camera and gimbal. Using the Mobile SDK, create a customized mobile app to unlock the full potential of your DJI aerial platform.

## Running the SDK Sample Code

Developers can [run the sample application](https://developer.dji.com/mobile-sdk/documentation/quick-start/index.html) to immediately run code and see how the DJI Mobile SDK can be used.

One of DJI's aircraft or handheld cameras will be required to run the sample application.

## Development Workflow

## Package Name Replace Script

Since Android SDK 3.3 or above has changed or deprecated some package names or class names, we provide an executableÂ JAR file, which contains scripts for you to replace old package names (SDK Version 3.2.1 or below ) to new package name (SDK Version 3.3 or  above) automatically. Please refer to [this link](./Executable JAR/README.md) for more details.
